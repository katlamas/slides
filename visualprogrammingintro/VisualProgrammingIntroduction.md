# Visual Programming - Introduction & Assessment Overview

---

## Brief Overview of the Unit**:

   - Unit Title: *Visual Programming* (Level 3, Credit Value: 3)
    - **Learning Outcomes**:
        - Understand the features and uses of visual programming
        - Be able to design a visual application
        - Be able to create visual applications using interactive features
        - Be able to test a visual program

---

### Unit Structure

- The unit is divided into 4 key tasks:
    - **Task 1**: Compare and contrast visual and sequential programming, explain the advantages and uses of event-driven programs
    - **Task 2**: Plan and design a visual application using an appropriate methodology (e.g., Agile, Waterfall, RAD)
    - **Task 3**: Develop an interactive visual application, focusing on maintainability and usability
    - **Task 4**: Test the application using black box and white box methods, document debugging processes

---

### Assessment Criteria

- **Practical**: Learnersd must develop a fully functioning visual application by the end of the unit
- Each task corresponds to Assessment Criteria (AC) that must be met for a pass:
    - **AC 1.1**: Compare visual and sequential programming
    - **AC 1.2**: Explain uses and advantages of event-driven programs
    - **AC 2.1 - 2.3**: Plan and design a modifiable visual application
    - **AC 3.1 - 3.2**: Build and document a maintainable visual application
    - **AC 4.1 - 4.3**: Create a testing plan, use debugging tools, explain the error-correction process

## 2. Exemplar Walkthrough



---

### Task 1: Compare and Contrast Visual and Sequential Programming

- **Pass Example**:
  - **Visual Programming**: Describes that visual programming uses graphical elements (e.g., Scratch, Visual Studio), eliminating the need for complex text-based code.
  - **Sequential Programming**: Defines it as step-by-step execution of tasks in a structured manner, with examples like Python and HTML.
  - **Comparison**: Offers a basic comparison, focusing on the general ease of use of visual programming versus the logic-based approach in sequential programming.

  - **Feedback**: While sufficient, the Pass level is basic and lacks depth in industry application or advanced examples.

---

- **Merit Example**:
  - **Visual Programming**: Describes visual programming in more detail, emphasizing tools like Scratch and Unity. Adds information about real-world applications like game development.
  - **Sequential Programming**: Provides a more in-depth analysis of sequential programming, referencing both high-level and low-level languages (e.g., Python, C++).
  - **Comparison**: Detailed similarities and differences, explaining the reuse of components in both paradigms. Supports with examples of where each programming type is used.

  - **Feedback**: A clearer breakdown of the similarities and differences, though additional detail on technical aspects could strengthen it further.

---

- **Distinction Example**:
  - **Visual Programming**: Thoroughly explains visual programming environments like Unreal Engine, discussing visual debugging, cross-platform capabilities, and collaborative workflows.
  - **Sequential Programming**: Provides an advanced discussion of sequential programming, including a detailed explanation of algorithm complexity, and its usage in systems programming and large-scale applications.
  - **Comparison**: Comprehensive comparison, complete with diagrams, industry examples (e.g., education, game development, software engineering), and a reflection on the benefits of each type for specific scenarios.

  - **Feedback**: This level shows a deep understanding of the two paradigms, including real-world applications, use cases, and a reflection on where each is most beneficial. Diagrams and technical examples elevate the quality of work significantly.

---

### Task 2: Planning and Developing an Application

- **Pass Example**:
  - Simple **Ping Pong Game** designed using Scratch.
  - **Planning**: The project includes a basic timeline (e.g., initial planning, building, testing) but lacks detail on methodology. Agile is mentioned but not explained fully.
  
  - **Feedback**: The basic structure is present, but more thought is required for design decisions. A simple project idea with minimal technical complexity.

---

- **Merit Example**:
  - **Pong Battle Royale** game with more advanced features (e.g., weapons, scoring).
  - **Planning**: The student selects Agile methodology, provides justification with comparisons to Waterfall and RAD. Creates a structured six-week sprint plan covering research, development, testing, and feedback.
  
  - **Feedback**: The Merit example offers good structure and justification for design choices. The sprint plan is well-detailed, though more technical depth could elevate the project further.

---

- **Distinction Example**:
  - A complex **3D Horror Game** using Unreal Engine 5.
  - **Planning**: The student provides a detailed design methodology, explaining why they chose RAD over Waterfall and Agile. The plan is broken down into phases with timelines, feedback integration, and continuous development.
  
  - **Feedback**: The Distinction example shows excellent planning with real-time adjustments based on user feedback. The project scope is ambitious, and the methodology is thoroughly explained, reflecting deep understanding and careful planning.

---

### Task 3: Application Development and Debugging

- **Pass Example**:
  - A simple **Ping Pong Game** developed in Scratch, with basic debugging (e.g., fixing movement glitches).
  
  - **Feedback**: Functional, but with minimal complexity. The debugging process is not thoroughly explored, and more reflection on problem-solving would improve the work.

---

- **Merit Example**:
  - **Pong Battle Royale** with advanced game mechanics. The student identifies and resolves issues with ball dynamics and scoring systems.
  
  - **Feedback**: Shows more sophistication in the development and debugging process. The debugging is practical but lacks the technical reflection seen in higher grades.

---

- **Distinction Example**:
  - A fully developed **3D Horror Game** in Unreal Engine 5, featuring complex AI behaviors and dynamic lighting.
  - **Debugging**: Detailed breakdown of debugging techniques (e.g., AI pathfinding, object collisions), supported by screenshots and descriptions of solutions implemented.
  
  - **Feedback**: The level of technical detail and reflection is excellent, with complex problem-solving skills on display. Thorough documentation and analysis of issues demonstrate a strong understanding of the debugging process.

## 3. Grading Standards



---

### Knowledge and Understanding

- **Pass**: Basic understanding, general descriptions of concepts without deep analysis or reflection.
- **Merit**: Broader understanding with more detailed examples, demonstrating connections between different concepts and applications.
