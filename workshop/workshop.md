# Radio Frequencies & Legal Considerations (UK & Latin America)

---

### **Understanding Radio Frequencies**

**What are radio frequencies?**
- Electromagnetic spectrum used for communication (e.g., radio, TV, Wi-Fi, LoRa).
- Measured in Hertz (Hz) and divided into frequency bands.
**Unlicensed vs. Licensed Bands**
- **Unlicensed bands** (free to use under specific power limits).
- **Licensed bands** (require government permits and regulations).

---

### **LoRa Frequency Bands by Region**

| **Region**    | **LoRa Frequency** | **Usage**                               |
| ------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| UK & Europe   | 868 MHz            | Unlicensed ISM band                     |
| Latin America | 915 MHz            | Unlicensed ISM band (in most countries) |
| USA           | 915 MHz            | Unlicensed ISM band                     |
| Africa        | Varies             | Country-dependent                       |
| Asia          | 433 MHz / 920 MHz  | Varies by country                       |

---

### **Legal Considerations**

**UK Regulations**
- Ofcom regulates spectrum usage.
- LoRa falls under ISM (Industrial, Scientific, Medical) bands, requiring low power transmission limits.
- Maximum **transmission power**: 14 dBm (25mW) for 868 MHz.

---


### **Legal Considerations**


**Latin America Regulations**
- Many countries allow 915 MHz for LoRa in ISM bands (e.g., Mexico, Argentina, Brazil).
- Some require additional permissions or lower power limits.
- In some cases, **community radio and LoRa networks face legal uncertainty** due to centralized telecom regulations.

---

### **Community Radio & LoRa Networks**

**Why are community radios important?**
- Provide **independent news and communication**.
- Serve **rural and Indigenous communities** without corporate media presence.

---


### **Community Radio & LoRa Networks**


**Can LoRa be used for radio transmission?**
- LoRa cannot transmit **audio**, but it can be used to send **text-based emergency messages** to community radio operators.
- Some projects experiment with **Internet-to-Radio bridges** to **transmit over FM radio via LoRa gateways**.

##  LoRa vs. Wi-Fi, Cellular, & Other Radio Networks

| Feature            | LoRa            | Wi-Fi          | Cellular          |
| ------------------ | --------------- | -------------- | ----------------- |

  # Scenario:

  It's the year 2033. Most of the world is ruled by totalitarian regimes. Telecommunications are controlled by governments and corporations.The voices that once carried resistance have been silenced.

  Governments own the airwaves, the satellites, the networks. Every whispered word, every thought shared across a signal, is under survillance. Privacy is a crime. Even silence is suspicious.

---

  We are a small community hiding in the quiet spaces left between surveillance towers and drones. We are not many, and we have little. But we have our minds, our stories, and the will to survive in a world that wants us erased.


  We need to reach one another. To warn, to teach, to build. We need to create our own communication system. 

  We only have **these devices**.  But they are only tools. The real work is deciding how we use them.

  **How can we establish a communication system that allows us to remain connected while staying outside the control of oppressive systems?**

------

  ### **Discussion Questions:**

  1. **Network Topology**

     - Do we build a **centralized** system: one stronghold, one access point, easy to organize but vulnerable to attack?

     - Or do we weave a **decentralized** mesh: each of us a node, harder to find, harder to destroy?

     - How do we choose? How do we survive?

---


  ### **Discussion Questions:**


  2. **Roles in the Community**

     - Who is responsible for maintaining the network,keeps it alive, fixes what breaks?
     - Who teaches the young, ensures that knowledge is passed and not lost?
     - How do we keep our communication alive without creating a hierarchy that can be corrupted?

---

  ### **Discussion Questions:**



  3. **Security & Anonymity**

     - How do we balance trust and protection?
     - Should we implement authentication systems to ensure only trusted members can access the network?

# LoRa Topologies & Network Concepts

------

## **üåê LoRa Network Topologies: Understanding How We Communicate**

In this experiment, we will create **two different network topologies** using **LilyGO LoRa32** devices to explore how off-grid communication works.

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Mesh Network**

**üîó How it Works:**

- Multiple **LoRa nodes** are connected within the **Meshtastic network**.
- Each node **communicates directly** with others within range.
- Messages can **hop** between nodes to **extend communication range**.
- The network is **fully decentralized**‚Äîno central authority or access point is needed.

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Mesh Network**


**Key Characteristics:**

**‚úÖ No central coordination**‚Äîeach device is both sender and relay.

**‚úÖ End-to-end encrypted communication**.

**‚úÖ Good for emergency use** when centralized networks fail.

**üìå Real-World Example:** Used in **protest movements, disaster response, and remote communities** where traditional internet or cellular services are unavailable.

------

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ LoRa Access Point (AP) Network with Broadcast Transmission**

**üì° How it Works:**

- Three **LoRa devices act as Access Points (APs)**, creating a **backbone network**.
- The APs communicate via **broadcast messages**, relaying data across the system.
- Other devices (e.g., smartphones, computers) **connect to the APs** to access the network.
- Devices can **send messages to each other through the AP infrastructure**.

---


### **2Ô∏è‚É£ LoRa Access Point (AP) Network with Broadcast Transmission**


**Key Characteristics:**

**‚úÖ Supports multiple users via centralized APs**.

**‚úÖ Devices do not need direct LoRa connections‚Äîthey connect through APs**.

**‚úÖ Easier integration with existing Wi-Fi devices** (e.g., sending LoRa messages from a phone).

**üìå Real-World Example:** Used in **community radio projects, local messaging networks, and sensor-based IoT applications**.

------

## **üí° Basic Networking Concepts to Understand These Topologies**

**Nodes & Hops**

- **Node**: Any device in the network (LoRa module, phone, etc.).
- **Hop**: When a message travels from one node to another, extending its reach.

---

### **Decentralized vs. Centralized Networks**

| **Feature**     | **Peer-to-Peer (P2P)**                | **Access Point (AP) Network**  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Structure**   | Fully decentralized                   | Central APs manage the network |
| **Reliability** | Can work without power infrastructure | Depends on APs staying online  |
| **Scalability** | Expands with more nodes               | Limited to AP coverage         |

---

### **Broadcast vs. Direct Communication**

- **Broadcast**: Messages are sent to all nodes (useful for announcements or emergency alerts).
- **Direct Communication**: Messages are sent to a specific node only (ensures privacy but requires routing).

------

### **üîç Which Topology is Best?**

- **P2P Mesh:** Best for fully **off-grid communication** with no reliance on infrastructure.

- **AP Network:** Best for **structured communication**, allowing integration with phones and computers.
