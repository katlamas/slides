# **Prototyping & Interaction Design**
### **Building Interactive Prototypes in Figma**


---

## **What is Prototyping?**
- A prototype is an interactive **mockup** of a digital product.
- Helps visualize user **flows** and **interactions**.
- Reduces development costs by testing ideas early.



---

## **Why is Interaction Design Important?**
- Enhances **user experience (UX)**.

- Defines how users interact with interfaces.

**📘 Key Principles**:
1. Clarity
2. Consistency
3. Feedback
4. Simplicity

---

# **1️⃣ Understand Your User Persona**

### **Why is Understanding Users Important?**

- Before designing a prototype, you must understand **who** your users are and **what** they need.
- User personas **help designers create solutions** that are functional and meaningful.
- A good user persona is based on **research, not assumptions**.

---

### **How to Conduct User Research?**

**✔ Surveys & Interviews:** Direct conversations with potential users.

**✔ Behavioral Analytics:** Observing how users interact with existing solutions.

**✔ Competitor Analysis:** Understanding what works in similar products.



------

# **1️⃣ Understand Your User Persona**

### **Building a Detailed User Persona**

A **user persona** should include:
**📌 Demographics** – Age, gender, location, education, etc.
**📌 Goals & Motivations** – What drives the user to engage with the product?
**📌 Pain Points** – What are their frustrations?
**📌 Behavior Patterns** – How do they interact with similar products?

---

#### **Example of a User Persona**

**👩‍💻 Name:** Maria, 25, UX Design Student

**🎯 Goal:** Create interactive prototypes efficiently

**😖 Pain Points:** Struggles with learning complex Figma features

**🛠️ Solution:** A guided prototyping tool that simplifies key steps



------

# **2️⃣ Layout & Space Considerations**

### **Why Layout & Space Matter in Prototyping**

**✔** Good layout **improves usability** and **reduces cognitive load**.

**✔** Effective use of space ensures a **clean and organized** interface.

**✔ Gestalt principles** help designers structure elements effectively.

---

### **Principles of Visual Hierarchy**

**✅ Size & Scale:** Bigger elements attract attention first.

**✅ Contrast:** Using color and brightness to create focus areas.

**✅ Typography:** Larger and bolder text for key messages.



------

# **2️⃣ Layout & Space Considerations**

### **Using Gestalt Principles in Prototyping**

**Gestalt Principles** help users quickly understand the relationships between elements:
 **✔ Proximity:** Items close together are perceived as related.
 **✔ Similarity:** Elements with similar colors, sizes, or shapes appear connected.
 **✔ Closure:** Users naturally "fill in the gaps" to complete visual patterns.
 **✔ Figure-Ground:** Differentiating important elements from the background.

---

### **Applying These Principles in Figma**

**✔** Use **consistent spacing** between related items.
 
**✔** Avoid **clutter** – too much information confuses users.

**✔** Utilize **grids and alignment** to create a structured look.



------

# **3️⃣ Interaction Design & HCI Principles**

### **What is Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)?**

- **HCI** focuses on how users interact with digital interfaces.

- It ensures that designs are **usable, efficient, and engaging**.

- A prototype should simulate **real-world interactions** to test usability.


---

### **Core Interaction Design Principles**

**📌 Affordance:** Elements should suggest their function (e.g., buttons look clickable).

**📌 Feedback:** The system must respond to user actions (e.g., hover effects).

**📌 Consistency:** Repeating patterns improve learnability.

**📌 Cognitive Load Reduction:** Simplify tasks to avoid user frustration.



------

# **3️⃣ Interaction Design & HCI Principles**

### **Designing for Intuitive Navigation**

**✔** Use a **clear navigation structure** – users should know where they are and what to do next.

**✔** Implement **predictable interactions** – avoid unexpected UI behaviors.

**✔** Make important **actions visible and accessible**.

---

### **Reducing Cognitive Load**

**📌 Chunking:** Break information into smaller, digestible pieces.

**📌 Progressive Disclosure:** Only show relevant information when needed.

**📌 Recognition Over Recall:** Provide clear labels and shortcuts instead of making users remember actions.



------

# **4️⃣ Storytelling in Prototyping**

### **Why Storytelling Matters in Design**

- Storytelling **makes interactions more engaging**.

- Users connect better with designs that follow **a logical journey**.

- A strong story **guides user actions** effectively.

---

### **How to Incorporate Storytelling?**

**✔** Use a **beginning (onboarding), middle (interaction), and end (confirmation)** structure.

**✔** Design with **emotional triggers** – color, typography, and micro-interactions.

**✔** Add **clear narratives** – explain why users should complete an action.



------

# **5️⃣ Simplifying Complexity in Design**

### **Why Simplicity is Essential?**

- Users get frustrated with **overly complex** interfaces.

- Simplicity improves **efficiency and satisfaction**.

- A prototype should **focus on core functionalities** before adding extra features.


---


### **Techniques for Reducing Complexity**

**✔ Remove Unnecessary Elements:** Keep only what users need.

**✔ Break Down Tasks:** Split long processes into smaller steps.

**✔ Use Familiar Patterns:** Follow common UI conventions.

**✔ Offer Guided Interactions:** Tooltips, highlights, and onboarding flows help users navigate complex tasks.



------

# **6️⃣ Web & Responsive Design Guidelines**

### **What is Responsive Design?**

- A design that **adapts to different screen sizes**.
- Ensures a consistent experience on **mobile, tablet, and desktop**.
- Uses **fluid grids, flexible images, and media queries**.


---


### **Best Practices for Web Design**

**✔ Mobile-First Approach:** Design for the smallest screen first.

**✔ Grid-Based Layouts:** Maintain alignment and spacing.

**✔ Consistent UI Components:** Buttons, menus, and interactions should remain the same across devices.



------

# **6️⃣ Web & Responsive Design Guidelines**

### **Common Mistakes in Responsive Design**

**❌ Overloading Mobile Screens:** Too much content reduces usability.

**❌ Not Testing Across Devices:** Always preview your design on different screens.

**❌ Ignoring Accessibility:** Ensure text is readable and buttons are easy to tap.


---


### **How to Prototype for Responsive Design in Figma**

**✔** Use **Auto Layout** to create flexible components.

**✔** Test prototypes in **mobile view** before scaling up.

**✔** Ensure text and UI elements **resize correctly**.



---

## Creating a Clickable Prototype
### Step 1: Define Your User Flow
- Start with **wireframes** or a UI design.
- Identify key **screens** and **navigation points**.



---

## **Step 2: Setting Up Prototyping in Figma**
1. Select an element (e.g., a button).
2. Click on the **Prototype** tab.
3. Drag the blue circle to the target screen.
4. Choose an **interaction (e.g., "On Click")**.

**🛠 Exercise**: Connect at least **three screens** in Figma.



---

## **Prototyping Your Own Design**
### 🎯 Task:

- Create at least **3-screen prototype** for your app.

  



---

## **Peer Review & Feedback**
**💡 How to give constructive feedback:**
1. **Clarity**: Is the flow intuitive?
2. **Usability**: Is it easy to navigate?

**🎤 Activity**: Present your prototype. Test your peers prototypes.

---

### Homework:
## Research the state of the art of applications that are comparable to your project
