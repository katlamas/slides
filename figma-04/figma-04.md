## Week 3: 
# Information Architecture & Wireframing

---

## Learning Outcomes
- Organize content using **sitemaps** and **user flows**
- Develop **low-fidelity** **wireframes**
- Build interactive **prototypes** with user interactions, transitions, and animations

---

## Information Architecture
**What is Information Architecture (IA)?**
  - Organizing content logically and intuitively.
  - Ensures users can easily navigate and find information.

**Why is IA important in UX Design?**
  - Enhances usability and user experience.

## Sitemaps & User Flows

---

## Sitemaps
- A visual representation of a website's hierarchical structure.
- Shows navigation paths and content organization.

---

## User Flows
- Illustrates the steps a user takes to complete a task.
- Helps design intuitive navigation.

## Low-Fidelity vs. High-Fidelity Wireframes

---
**Low-Fidelity Wireframes:**
- Basic layouts without detailed design elements.
- Focus on functionality and content placement.
- Quick to produce and easy to modify.

---
**High-Fidelity Wireframes:**
- Detailed representations with precise spacing, annotations, and sometimes actual content.
- Closer to the final design but more time-consuming to create.

**Wireframes**
## Importance of Wireframing

**Clarifies Structure:** Helps in organizing content and functionality before the design phase.

**Facilitates Communication:** Serves as a tool for discussion among stakeholders, designers, and developers.

**Identifies Usability Issues:** Allows early detection of potential navigation and interface problems.

---

**Wireframes**
## Elements of a Wireframe
**Information Design:** Presentation and prioritization of information to facilitate understanding.

**Navigation Design:** Designing the system that allows users to move through the interface.

**Interface Design:** Arrangement of interactive elements like buttons, text fields, and menus.

---

**Wireframes**
## Steps to Create a Wireframe
**Gather Requirements:** Understand user needs and business objectives.

**Define User Flows:** Map out the steps a user takes to complete tasks.

**Sketch Layouts:** Begin with low-fidelity sketches to establish structure.

**Develop Detailed Wireframes:** Transition to high-fidelity wireframes, adding details and annotations.

**Review and Iterate:** Seek feedback and refine the wireframes accordingly.

---

**Wireframes**
## Other Tools for Wireframing

- Sketch
- Adobe XD
- Balsamiq
- Traditional Methods: Pen and paper or whiteboard sketches for initial ideas.

---

**Wireframes**
## Best Practices in Wireframing
**Stay User-Focused:** Design with the end-user's needs and behaviors in mind.

**Keep It Simple:** Avoid unnecessary details that can clutter the wireframe.

**Use Placeholders:** Indicate where images, videos, or other media will be placed with boxes.

**Be Consistent:** Maintain uniformity in design elements and spacing.

**Annotate Clearly:** Provide notes to explain functionality and interactive elements.

**Use two fonts max:**  Limit yourself to two fonts to make the hierarchy clear.

---

**Wireframes**
## Consider screen size
Three questions that might drastically influence your wireframe or versions of your wireframe include:

**Supported devices:** Your design adapts to support desktop and mobile.

**Screen orientation:** Depending on if youâ€™re looking at the design in portrait or landscape, some things might need to shift and resize.

**Context of use:** If a specific feature in your product is more geared to desktop use, consider cutting it from the mobile version upfront.

---

**Wireframes**
## Common Mistakes to Avoid
**Skipping the Wireframing Phase:** Jumping directly into design can lead to structural issues later.

**Overcomplicating Designs:** Adding too much detail too soon can be counterproductive.

**Neglecting User Needs:** Focusing solely on aesthetics without considering usability.

**Lack of Collaboration:** Not involving stakeholders and team members early in the process.
