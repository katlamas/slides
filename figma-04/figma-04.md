## Week 3: 
# Information Architecture & Wireframing

---

## Learning Outcomes
- Organize content using **sitemaps** and **user flows**
- Develop **low-fidelity** **wireframes**
- Build interactive **prototypes** with user interactions, transitions, and animations

---

## Information Architecture
**What is Information Architecture (IA)?**
  - Organizing content logically and intuitively.
  - Ensures users can easily navigate and find information.

**Why is IA important in UX Design?**
  - Enhances usability and user experience.

**Wireframes**
## Importance of Wireframing

**Clarifies Structure:** Helps in organizing content and functionality before the design phase.

**Facilitates Communication:** Serves as a tool for discussion among stakeholders, designers, and developers.

**Identifies Usability Issues:** Allows early detection of potential navigation and interface problems.

---

**Wireframes**
## Low-Fidelity vs. High-Fidelity Wireframes

**Low-Fidelity Wireframes:**
- Basic layouts without detailed design elements.
- Focus on functionality and content placement.
- Quick to produce and easy to modify.

**High-Fidelity Wireframes:**
- Detailed representations with precise spacing, annotations, and sometimes actual content.
- Closer to the final design but more time-consuming to create.

---

**Wireframes**
## Elements of a Wireframe
**Information Design:** Presentation and prioritization of information to facilitate understanding.

**Navigation Design:** Designing the system that allows users to move through the interface.

**Interface Design:** Arrangement of interactive elements like buttons, text fields, and menus.

---

**Wireframes**
## Steps to Create a Wireframe
**Gather Requirements:** Understand user needs and business objectives.

**Define User Flows:** Map out the steps a user takes to complete tasks.

**Sketch Layouts:** Begin with low-fidelity sketches to establish structure.

**Develop Detailed Wireframes:** Transition to high-fidelity wireframes, adding details and annotations.

**Review and Iterate:** Seek feedback and refine the wireframes accordingly.

---

**Wireframes**
## Other Tools for Wireframing

- Sketch
- Adobe XD
- Balsamiq
- Traditional Methods: Pen and paper or whiteboard sketches for initial ideas.

---

**Wireframes**
## Best Practices in Wireframing
**Stay User-Focused:** Design with the end-user's needs and behaviors in mind.

**Keep It Simple:** Avoid unnecessary details that can clutter the wireframe.

**Use Placeholders:** Indicate where images, videos, or other media will be placed.

**Be Consistent:** Maintain uniformity in design elements and spacing.

**Annotate Clearly:** Provide notes to explain functionality and interactive elements.

---

**Wireframes**
## Common Mistakes to Avoid
**Skipping the Wireframing Phase:** Jumping directly into design can lead to structural issues later.

**Overcomplicating Designs:** Adding too much detail too soon can be counterproductive.

**Neglecting User Needs:** Focusing solely on aesthetics without considering usability.

**Lack of Collaboration:** Not involving stakeholders and team members early in the process.

### Activity: Building Wireframes

https://www.figma.com/templates/wireframe-kits/

In pairs, create a wireframe for a mobile app or website.

Include a sitemap, user flow, and at least three linked pages.

**Focus on creating:**
- Clear navigation structure.
- Consistent layout and visual hierarchy.
- Interactive prototype demonstrating user flow.

---

## Instructions
Start by brainstorming the app's purpose and target users. Then:
1. Create a sitemap outlining the main navigation.
2. Sketch user flows for key tasks (e.g., signup, purchase).
3. Build wireframes for at least three linked screens.
4. Connect screens to create a clickable prototype.
5. Preview the prototype

---

**1. Create a Sitemap Outlining the Main Navigation**
## 1.1. Open Figma and Create a New Project
  - Go to [Figma](https://www.figma.com) and log in.
  - Click on **New File** to create a new project.
  - Rename the project to “Sitemap and Wireframes”.
---

**1. Create a Sitemap Outlining the Main Navigation**
## 1.2. Set up a Sitemap Structure
  - Use the **Frame Tool (F)** to create boxes representing each page (e.g., Home, About, Services, Contact).
  - Arrange these boxes hierarchically to represent the website’s structure.
  - Use **Lines (L)** or **Connectors** from the toolbar to link parent and child pages.
  - Label each box with the page name using the **Text Tool (T)**.
  - Group related pages to create logical sections (e.g., under “Services”, add “Consulting”, “Development”).
---

**1. Create a Sitemap Outlining the Main Navigation**
## 1.3. Style and Organize the Sitemap
  - Use consistent colors and font sizes for better readability.
  - Align boxes neatly using the **Align and Distribute** tools in the right panel.
  - Organize layers in the **Layers Panel** to keep the sitemap clean and navigable.

---

**2. Sketch User Flows for Key Tasks**
## 2.1. Identify Key Tasks and User Goals
  - Define the main tasks users will perform (e.g., Signing up, Purchasing a product).
  - List the steps required to complete each task.

---

**2. Sketch User Flows for Key Tasks**
## 2.2. Create User Flow Diagrams
  - In Figma, use the **Frame Tool (F)** to create screens for each step in the user journey.
  - Arrange the frames in a logical flow from start to finish.
  - Connect each frame with **Arrows** to show the navigation path.
  - Label each connection with the action (e.g., “Click Signup”, “Enter Details”, “Submit”).

---

**2. Sketch User Flows for Key Tasks**
## 2.3. Visualize Decision Points
  - Use **Diamonds** or **Decision Nodes** to represent choices (e.g., Successful login vs. Error).
  - Link to corresponding next steps (e.g., Redirect to Dashboard or Show Error Message).

---

**2. Sketch User Flows for Key Tasks**
## 2.4. Review and Optimize User Flows
  - Test the flow for logical consistency and ease of navigation.
  - Simplify steps where possible to reduce user friction.

---

**3. Build Wireframes for At Least Three Linked Screens**
## 3.1. Select a Device Frame
  - In Figma, click on **Frame Tool (F)** and select a device preset (e.g., iPhone 13, Desktop 1440px).
  - Create at least three frames for the main screens (e.g., Homepage, Signup Page, Dashboard).

---

**3. Build Wireframes for At Least Three Linked Screens**
## 3.2. Create a Layout Using Grids
  - Click on a frame and go to the right panel under **Layout Grid**.
  - Set up a grid system (e.g., 12-column grid for desktop, 4-column for mobile).
  - This helps maintain alignment and consistent spacing.

---

**3. Build Wireframes for At Least Three Linked Screens**
## 3.3. Add Placeholder Content
  - Use **Rectangles (R)** and **Circles (O)** as placeholders for images and buttons.
  - Add text using the **Text Tool (T)** to label sections like headers, navigation, and content.
  - Keep the wireframes low-fidelity by avoiding detailed styling.

---

**3. Build Wireframes for At Least Three Linked Screens**
## 3.4. Organize UI Components
  - Group related elements (e.g., Navbar, Footer) to maintain consistency across screens.
  - Reuse components using **Components and Instances** to ensure uniformity.

---

**4. Connect Screens to Create a Clickable Prototype**
## 4.1. Switch to Prototype Mode
  - In the top-right corner, switch from **Design** to **Prototype** mode.

---

**4. Connect Screens to Create a Clickable Prototype**
## 4.2. Link Interactive Elements
  - Select the interactive element (e.g., Button or Link).
  - Click on the blue circle on the right edge and drag it to the target screen.
  - Set the interaction (e.g., “On Click” → “Navigate to” → [Target Screen]).

---

**4. Connect Screens to Create a Clickable Prototype**
## 4.3. Define Transitions and Animations
  - In the right panel, select the transition type (e.g., “Slide In”, “Fade In”).
  - Adjust duration and easing for smooth animations.

---

**4. Connect Screens to Create a Clickable Prototype**
## 4.4 Organise elements 
- Name layers and frames clearly for easier navigation.
- Group related components (e.g., Header, Footer, Buttons) for cleaner organization.

---

## 5. Preview the Prototype
  - Click on **Present** (top right corner) to see the interactive prototype.
  - Test the flow to ensure all links and interactions work as intended.

---

## Peer Review and Feedback
Exchange wireframes with another pair.

Provide feedback on:
  - Usability and clarity of user flow.
  - Consistency and layout.
  - Navigation and interaction design.

---

## Recap
**Key takeaways:**
- Sitemaps and user flows help define a better user experience
- Wireframes simplify design iteration
