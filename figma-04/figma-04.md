## Week 3: 
# Information Architecture & Wireframing

---

## Learning Outcomes
- Organize content using sitemaps and user flows
- Develop low-fidelity wireframes
- Build interactive prototypes with user interactions, transitions, and animations

---

## Introduction to Information Architecture
- What is Information Architecture (IA)?
  - Organizing content logically and intuitively.
  - Ensures users can easily navigate and find information.
- Why is IA important in UX Design?
  - Enhances usability and user experience.

---

## What are Sitemaps and User Flows?
- Sitemap:
  - A visual representation of a website's hierarchical structure.
  - Shows navigation paths and content organization.
- User Flow:
  - Illustrates the steps a user takes to complete a task.
  - Helps design intuitive navigation.

---

## Examples of Sitemaps and User Flows
- Showcase examples of:
  - A well-organized sitemap.
  - A clear and intuitive user flow.
- Discuss the impact on user experience.

---

## Low-Fidelity Wireframes
- What are Wireframes?
  - Basic layouts without detailed design elements.
  - Focus on functionality and content placement.
- Why use Low-Fidelity Wireframes?
  - Quick iteration and feedback.
  - Emphasis on user experience over visual design.

---

## Wireframing in Figma
1. Open Figma and create a new project.
2. Use 'Frames' to define screen layouts.
3. Organize content using grids and sections.
4. Add placeholders for text, images, and buttons.
5. Link pages to create a clickable prototype.

---

### Activity: Building Wireframes

In pairs, create a wireframe for a mobile app or website.

Include a sitemap, user flow, and at least three linked pages.

**Requirements:**
- Clear navigation structure.
- Consistent layout and visual hierarchy.
- Interactive prototype demonstrating user flow.

---
### Building Wireframes
## Instructions
1. Brainstorm the app's purpose and target users.
2. Create a sitemap outlining the main navigation.
3. Sketch user flows for key tasks (e.g., signup, purchase).
4. Build wireframes for at least three linked screens.
5. Connect screens to create a clickable prototype.
6. Test and iterate based on peer feedback.
7. Upload their wireframes and prototypes for assessment.

## Create a Sitemap Outlining the Main Navigation
1. **Open Figma and Create a New Project**
   - Go to [Figma](https://www.figma.com) and log in.
   - Click on **New File** to create a new project.
   - Rename the project to “Sitemap and Wireframes”.
---

## Create a Sitemap Outlining the Main Navigation
2. **Set up a Sitemap Structure**
   - Use the **Frame Tool (F)** to create boxes representing each page (e.g., Home, About, Services, Contact).
   - Arrange these boxes hierarchically to represent the website’s structure.
   - Use **Lines (L)** or **Connectors** from the toolbar to link parent and child pages.
   - Label each box with the page name using the **Text Tool (T)**.
   - Group related pages to create logical sections (e.g., under “Services”, add “Consulting”, “Development”).

3. **Style and Organize the Sitemap**
   - Use consistent colors and font sizes for better readability.
   - Align boxes neatly using the **Align and Distribute** tools in the right panel.
   - Organize layers in the **Layers Panel** to keep the sitemap clean and navigable.

---

## Sketch User Flows for Key Tasks (e.g., Signup, Purchase)
1. **Identify Key Tasks and User Goals**
   - Define the main tasks users will perform (e.g., Signing up, Purchasing a product).
   - List the steps required to complete each task.

---

## Sketch User Flows for Key Tasks (e.g., Signup, Purchase)
2. **Create User Flow Diagrams**
   - In Figma, use the **Frame Tool (F)** to create screens for each step in the user journey.
   - Arrange the frames in a logical flow from start to finish.
   - Connect each frame with **Arrows** to show the navigation path.
   - Label each connection with the action (e.g., “Click Signup”, “Enter Details”, “Submit”).

---

## Sketch User Flows for Key Tasks (e.g., Signup, Purchase)
3. **Visualize Decision Points**
   - Use **Diamonds** or **Decision Nodes** to represent choices (e.g., Successful login vs. Error).
   - Link to corresponding next steps (e.g., Redirect to Dashboard or Show Error Message).

---

## Sketch User Flows for Key Tasks (e.g., Signup, Purchase)
4. **Review and Optimize User Flows**
   - Test the flow for logical consistency and ease of navigation.
   - Simplify steps where possible to reduce user friction.

---

## Build Wireframes for At Least Three Linked Screens
1. **Select a Device Frame**
   - In Figma, click on **Frame Tool (F)** and select a device preset (e.g., iPhone 13, Desktop 1440px).
   - Create at least three frames for the main screens (e.g., Homepage, Signup Page, Dashboard).

---

## Build Wireframes for At Least Three Linked Screens

2. **Create a Layout Using Grids**
   - Click on a frame and go to the right panel under **Layout Grid**.
   - Set up a grid system (e.g., 12-column grid for desktop, 4-column for mobile).
   - This helps maintain alignment and consistent spacing.

---

## Build Wireframes for At Least Three Linked Screens

3. **Add Placeholder Content**
   - Use **Rectangles (R)** and **Circles (O)** as placeholders for images and buttons.
   - Add text using the **Text Tool (T)** to label sections like headers, navigation, and content.
   - Keep the wireframes low-fidelity by avoiding detailed styling.

---

## Build Wireframes for At Least Three Linked Screens

4. **Organize UI Components**
   - Group related elements (e.g., Navbar, Footer) to maintain consistency across screens.
   - Reuse components using **Components and Instances** to ensure uniformity.

---

## Connect Screens to Create a Clickable Prototype
1. **Switch to Prototype Mode**
   - In the top-right corner, switch from **Design** to **Prototype** mode.
