## Week 3: 
# Information Architecture & Wireframing

---

## Learning Outcomes
- Organize content using sitemaps and user flows
- Develop low-fidelity wireframes
- Build interactive prototypes with user interactions, transitions, and animations

---

## Introduction to Information Architecture
- What is Information Architecture (IA)?
  - Organizing content logically and intuitively.
  - Ensures users can easily navigate and find information.
- Why is IA important in UX Design?
  - Enhances usability and user experience.

---

## What are Sitemaps and User Flows?
- Sitemap:
  - A visual representation of a website's hierarchical structure.
  - Shows navigation paths and content organization.
- User Flow:
  - Illustrates the steps a user takes to complete a task.
  - Helps design intuitive navigation.

---

## Examples of Sitemaps and User Flows
- Showcase examples of:
  - A well-organized sitemap.
  - A clear and intuitive user flow.
- Discuss the impact on user experience.

---

## Low-Fidelity Wireframes
- What are Wireframes?
  - Basic layouts without detailed design elements.
  - Focus on functionality and content placement.
- Why use Low-Fidelity Wireframes?
  - Quick iteration and feedback.
  - Emphasis on user experience over visual design.

---

## Wireframing in Figma
1. Open Figma and create a new project.
2. Use 'Frames' to define screen layouts.
3. Organize content using grids and sections.
4. Add placeholders for text, images, and buttons.
5. Link pages to create a clickable prototype.

---

### Activity: Building Wireframes

In pairs, create a wireframe for a mobile app or website.

Include a sitemap, user flow, and at least three linked pages.

**Requirements:**
- Clear navigation structure.
- Consistent layout and visual hierarchy.
- Interactive prototype demonstrating user flow.

---

## Instructions
1. Brainstorm the app's purpose and target users.
2. Create a sitemap outlining the main navigation.
3. Sketch user flows for key tasks (e.g., signup, purchase).
4. Build wireframes for at least three linked screens.
5. Connect screens to create a clickable prototype.
6. Test and iterate based on peer feedback.
7. Upload their wireframes and prototypes for assessment.

---

## Peer Review and Feedback
- Exchange wireframes with another pair.
- Provide feedback on:
  - Usability and clarity of user flow.
  - Consistency and layout.
  - Navigation and interaction design.
- Constructive criticism and positive communication.

---

## Recap
- Recap key takeaways:
  - Importance of sitemaps and user flows.
  - How wireframes simplify design iteration.
- Open floor for questions and feedback.
- Preview of next week's topic: Prototyping and Interaction Design.
