# Visual Programming Tools

---

## Scratch

[https://scratch.mit.edu/](https://scratch.mit.edu/)

Scratch is a visual programming tool.

You can use it to make games, stories, and animations.

With Scratch, you create by dragging and connecting blocks.

It’s easy to get started and learn coding.
We will learn about **blocks**, **sprites**, **backdrops**, and **how to run projects**.

## Blocks
Blocks are pieces of code that you connect.

Each block tells the computer what to do.

With blocks, you can make things move, make sounds, or control how they look.

## Sprites
Sprites are characters or objects in your game or project.

Sprites can talk, walk, or do actions based on the blocks you use.

## Backdrops
Backdrops are the backgrounds of your game or project.

They set the scene, like a location or environment.

You can switch backdrops to show different places.

---

## Running Projects
To see your project work, click the green flag.

You can stop the project by clicking the red stop sign.

---

## Flow Control

Flow control lets you decide how the program runs.

It controls what happens next, depending on conditions.

You can use **loops** and **selectors** to control the flow of your code.

---

**Loops**
## While Loops
![bg right h:100%](../img/control/while.png)

A while loop keeps repeating as long as a condition is true.

It will stop when the condition is false.

For example, keep looping while the user presses a key.

---

**Loops**
## For Loops
![bg right w:100%](../img/control/for.png)

A for loop repeats a set of actions a specific number of times.

You tell it how many times to run.

For example, it can count from 1 to 10 and do something each time.

---

**Selectors**
## If
![bg right h:100%](../img/control/if.png)

An if statement checks if something is true.

If it’s true, it runs the next block of code.

For example, if it’s raining, the program will say “Take an umbrella!”

---

**Selectors**
## Else
![bg right w:100%](../img/control/else.png)

Else happens when the 'if' condition is not true.

It runs a different set of actions when the condition is false.

For example, if it’s not raining, the program says, “Enjoy the sunshine!”

---

**Selectors**
## Elif
![bg right:54% h:100%](../img/control/elif.png)

Elif means "else if" and adds more conditions to check.

If the first if isn’t true, it checks another condition.

For example, if it’s sunny, say “Wear sunglasses,” elif it’s cloudy, say “Take a jacket.”

### Activity 1
## Catch Game
Go to the Scratch tutorial document on Teams.

## EduBlocks

[https://edublocks.org/](https://edublocks.org/)

EduBlocks is a tool that helps you learn Python using blocks.

It turns blocks into real Python code you can see and run.

---

**EduBlocks**
## Code View

Code View shows the Python code your blocks make.

It helps you understand what each block does in Python.

You can switch between blocks and code to learn both ways.
