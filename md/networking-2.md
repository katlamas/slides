## Learning Objectives

<span class="lo-20">2.</span> <span>Be able to use networking devices and software</span>

<span class="lo-21">2.1.</span> Set up a simple computer network using devices which interact and operate correctly, e.g. client server or peer-to-peer.

<span class="lo-22">2.2.</span> Install computer network software to enable the creation of administrator and restricted accounts, e.g. network utility tools, network operating systems and pplication software.

<span class="lo-23">2.3.</span> Transfer stored files across a computer network using two protocols, e.g. FTP and TCP/IP.

## Introduction to Packet Tracer
**Cisco Packet Tracer** is a powerful _network simulation_ tool that allows users to design, visualize, and troubleshoot network topologies in a virtual environment.

It's an essential tool for network professionals, students, and educators to practice networking concepts _without the need for physical hardware_.

## Basic Components in Packet Tracer
Packet Tracer offers a wide range of network devices to create diverse topologies. The most fundamental components include:
- PCs (Personal Computers)
- Switches
- Routers
